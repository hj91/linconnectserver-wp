This client is slightly modified version of linconnectclient which is originally available here - https://github.com/hauckwill/linconnect-client

This version offers a persistant storage for android notifications that can be viewed from anywhere on web. It uses wordpress as backend for storing the mirrored notifications. This works more good then pushbullet or other services because it offers a total control over storing/retriving/viewing your notifications. 


Todo

1. Read incoming SMS and mirror them on wordpress blog or email.
2. Add xmpp support to enable more advanced features.
3. Check for some more elaborate debugging and notifications on handset.
